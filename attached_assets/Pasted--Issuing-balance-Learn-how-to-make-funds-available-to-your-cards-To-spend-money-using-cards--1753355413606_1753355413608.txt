# Issuing balance

Learn how to make funds available to your cards.

To spend money using cards, add funds to the Issuing balance on your account. This balance represents funds reserved for Issuing and is safely separated from your earnings, payouts, and funds from other Stripe products.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

#### Push funding

Using the Stripe Dashboard or API, you can access the bank account and routing information you need to push funds from your external bank account. When that account receives funds, they’re immediately available as a [top-up](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups.md) to your Stripe account’s Issuing balance.

For a given currency, the provided bank account information will be unique and able to receive funds any number of times. Funds always arrive in your Issuing balance in the specified currency. In some cases, your bank might perform currency conversion.

## Create Funding Instructions with the API

> This API is currently only available for users with an activated account in the Euro area or United Kingdom.

To access account information for pushing funds, use the create Funding Instruction endpoint.

This returns unique instructions for your merchant account or each Connect account to push funds to using a bank transfer.

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/issuing/funding_instructions \
  -u <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>: \
  -d "funding_type"="bank_transfer" \
  -d "bank_transfer[type]"="eu_bank_transfer" \
  -d "currency"="eur"
```

If the request succeeds, it returns a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "object": "funding_instructions",
  "bank_transfer": {
    "country": "DE",
    "financial_addresses": [
      {

```

## Test pushing funds with the Funding Instructions API

You can simulate a bank transfer to the Issuing balance through the test-only [Fund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/funding_instructions/fund.md) endpoint. To specify the transfer amount, provide the `amount` parameter with a positive integer in the smallest currency unit. You must also specify the currency that you want the simulated funds to arrive in. For example, to create a test transfer of 1.00 EUR, use `100` as the amount, and `eur` as the currency.

After simulating a bank transfer, the specified amount is then added to the test Issuing balance. View your updated balance from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview#issuing-summary.md) or the [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve.md) endpoint. Each call to the test endpoint simulates a new bank transfer.

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/test_helpers/issuing/fund_balance \
  -u <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>: \
  -d "amount"=100 \
  -d "currency"="eur"
```

#### Funding from Stripe Balance

# Transferring funds from your Stripe balance

You can add funds to your Issuing balance by transferring funds from your main Stripe balance. Transfers from your Stripe balance are instant and available 24x7 in the US, or take one business day in the UK and euro area countries. This allows you to quickly and easily utilize earned funds from Stripe Payments for spend with Stripe Issuing.

You can only move an amount up to your available Stripe balance. Funds won’t be available in your Issuing balance while the transfer is pending.

## Transferring balances in the Dashboard

1. Click **Add to balance button** within the Issuing balance section of your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview#issuing-summary.md) balances page.
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/issuing-balance-2.e12d5bc02b6dc2e157e016e06ed07877.png)

1. Choose to add funds to your **Issuing balance**.

You can initiate a transfer to your Issuing balance directly from your Stripe balance. If you have any Stripe balance available to use, you’ll see the amounts in the drop down when initiating a balance transfer.

The amounts available to use in the Stripe balance for transfers are broken down by [source_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-available-source_types.md). For example, if your Stripe balance contains $10.00 where the `source_type` is `card` and $20.00 where the `source_type` is `bank_account`, you can choose either **From card balance ($10.00)** or **From bank account balance ($20.00)** as your funding source.
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/balance-transfer-dashboard-1.df0cf7a834e1aa7aa7001d7deb5f9beb.png)

1. Choose how much to add to your Issuing balance after clicking **Add to Balance**.

  Amount = 2000,
  Currency = "usd",
  Description = "Top-up for Issuing, July 24, 2025",
  StatementDescriptor = "Top-up",
};

options.AddExtraParam("destination_balance", "issuing");

service.Create(options);
```

Top-ups debit your bank account. Your top-ups can take up to 5 business days to become available. While they’re pending, they won’t be added to your Issuing balance.

## Track your Issuing balance

View your Issuing funds from your [balances dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview#issuing-summary.md).

To programmatically track the funds that are available to spend, look at the `issuing` object returned by the [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve.md) endpoint. This includes your available and pending Issuing funds.

#### curl

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance \

```

#### PHP

```php

// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
\Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

$balances = \Stripe\Balance::retrieve();
```

#### Java

```java

```json
{
  "object": "balance",
  "available": [
    {
      "amount": 0,
      "currency": "usd",
      "source_types": {
        "card": 0

    ]
  },

}
```

To track your pending Issuing balance, you can use the [list top-ups](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups/list.md) endpoint and filter on `status` of `pending`.

## Pay out your Issuing balance

To pay out your available Issuing funds, use the [create payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create.md) endpoint and set the `source_balance` of the payout to `issuing`.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d source_balance=issuing \
  -d amount=100 \
  -d currency=usd
```

```cli
stripe payouts create  \
  --source-balance=issuing \
  --amount=100 \
  --currency=usd
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
Stripe.api_key = '<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>'

payout = Stripe::Payout.create({
  source_balance: 'issuing',
  amount: 100,
  currency: 'usd',
})
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.

```

## Enable notifications about your balance

You can enable email notifications to help monitor your Issuing balance from your settings. To configure these notifications:

1. Visit your Balance notifications [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/issuing/balance-notifications.md) page.
1. Choose from two types of alerting thresholds:
   - Fixed amount: Receive an alert whenever your Issuing balance falls below this amount.
   - Ratio of balance to rolling spend: Receive an alert whenever the ratio of your Issuing balance to your spend over the previous 24 hours falls below the threshold. For example, if you set your threshold to 80% and your spend over the past day is 100 USD, you receive an alert whenever your balance falls below 80 USD.
